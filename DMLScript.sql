DML script for Mysql DB

from wikipedia:
In SQL, the data manipulation language comprises the SQL-data change statements, which modify stored data but not the schema or database objects. 
Manipulation of persistent database objects, e.g., tables or stored procedures, via the SQL schema statements, rather than the data stored within them, is considered to be part of a separate data definition language (DDL). 
In SQL these two categories are similar in their detailed syntax, data types, expressions etc., but distinct in their overall function.
The SQL-data change statements are a subset of the SQL-data statements; this also contains the SELECT query statement, which strictly speaking is part of the DQL, not the DML. 
In common practice though, this distinction is not made and SELECT is widely considered to be part of DML,so the DML consists of all SQL-data statements, not only the SQL-data change statements. 
The SELECT ... INTO ... form combines both selection and manipulation, and thus is strictly considered to be DML because it manipulates (i.e. modifies) data.
